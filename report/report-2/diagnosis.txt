Final diagnosis: Basal cell carcinoma. Critical findings: Superficial basal cell carcinoma with a tumor thickness of 0. 3 mm. Punch excision performed, with clear cutting edges. Microscopic findings: A punch biopsy reveals a fully ulcerated epidermis, with a solid tumor originating from the basal epidermis and extending into the upper corium. Notable palisades are positioned in the edge area, accompanied by retraction artifacts. There is peritumoral stromal induction and a subepidermal, loose lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrate with numerous melanophages.
